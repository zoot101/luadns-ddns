luadns-ddns (1.0.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for a custom notification hook. The notification
    hook is called like so:
    $ /path/to/notification/hook "Email Subject" "Email Body"
    $ /path/to/notification/hook "Email Subject" "Email Body" "Email Attachment"

  * Added a -c, -h, -f arguments to the script.
    -c|--config : Used to point the script to a different config file
    -f|--force  : Force an update via the Luadns.com REST API
    -h|--help   : Print a short help message

  * Moved times_to_update to config file from main script to allow
    editing it easily.

  * API Server Response for updating the record is now checked 
    directly for the Public IP instead of the "created_at" string.

  * Zone ID And Record ID responses are now checked that they are
    valid numbers.

  * Moved point where new IP is recorded for the next run until after
    successful API calls to update all record(s) at the end.

    - This is to ensure that in the case where the API server
      is down (rare!), the script will fail to update as expected, but
      will retry the next time it is called. Previously this was not the
      case.

  * Added the ability to update multiple records at once. However they
    should all belong to the same zone ie. be of the shape:
    record1.example.org, record2.example.org etc.

  * Added a notify_with_log parameter to the config file to allow
    disabling the sending of the notification emails and calls to the
    notification hook with the log file attached.

  * Added a debian/postinst and debian/postrm script to automate
    the installation to run as a user other than root, and remove
    the files generated if purged.

  * Installed systemd unit files into /lib/systemd/system instead
    of /etc/systemd/system

  * Changed working directory to /var/lib/luadns-ddns from 
    /var/tmp/luadns-ddns.

  * Added some wait time between the api calls when updates are
    carried out. Also added a number of retires (3) to curl calls
    to the API server.

  * Added dependency for wtmpdb or util-linux in debian/control for
    postinst script to ensure package installation works properly
    on trixie, bookworm and bullseye.

  * Code Cleanup - tidied up curl api calls, removed unecessary
    comments.

  * Updated manual entry.
